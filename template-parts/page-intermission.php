                <p class="pb-3" style="max-width: 700px;">War of the Worlds is a 2005 American science fiction action film[2] directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Josh Friedman and David Koepp, based on the 1897 novel by H. G. Wells and jointly produced and released by Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures. It stars Tom Cruise with Dakota Fanning, Justin Chatwin, Miranda Otto, and Tim Robbins in supporting roles, with narration by Morgan Freeman. The film follows an American dock worker who is forced to look after his children, from whom he lives separately, as he struggles to protect them and reunite them with their mother when extraterrestrials invade the Earth and devastate cities with giant war machines. It was Gene Barry's final film before his retirement that year and his death in 2009.</p>
